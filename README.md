# Bing Wallpaper Downloader

Simple CLI application written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to download
the Bing Image of the day and, optionally, set it as wallpaper or show a desktop
notification with the image and its caption.

## Build

The build phase requires `libdbus-1-dev` as dependency:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
```

Build:

```bash
cargo build           # Debug version
cargo build --release # Release version
```

## Install

Alternatively, you can directly install the application using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --path . --root ~/.local
```

`~/.local/bin` should be already in your `PATH` environment variable.

## How to use

Read the help message:

```bash
./bing_wallpaper_downloader download --help 
```

Download the image of the day in a specific folder. `-o` arg is optional. If it
is not provided the image will be saved in a predefined folder:

```bash
./bing_wallpaper_downloader download -o $HOME/Downloads/myimage.jpg 
```

Download image of a previous day, e.g., the image of 2 days ago:

```bash
./bing_wallpaper_downloader download -o $HOME/Downloads/myimage.jpg -p 2
```

Download the image of tha day and set it as wallpaper:

```bash
./bing_wallpaper_downloader download -s
```

Show a desktop notification with the image of the day and the caption:

```bash
./bing_wallpaper_downloader download -n
```

## Autostart

If you use `zsh`, to run the application at login and see a desktop notification
with the new photo of the day, append this line to the `~/.zlogin` file:

```bash
<PROJECT_PATH>/target/release/bing_wallpaper_downloader -n > /dev/null &
```

In alternative, `systemd` can be used to run the application at login or periodically using a timer. Files can be found in the `systemd` fodler in the repo. 

Just copy the files in the `~/.config/systemd/user` folder and run:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now bing-wallpaper.service bing-wallpaper.timer
```

## Development

The project contains the configuration to run a [VSCode developer
container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that can be
used to quicky setup the development environment. See
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for more
information.
